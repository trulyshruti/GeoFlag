        <p>GeoFlag is a file sharing service that allows you to set the terms of access. You can limit file access not only by user or time, but also by location.</p>

<p>To send a file, log in with Facebook, upload the file, then set the terms of access. Limit downloads to only certain locations or timeframes. To receive a file, log in with  Facebook, and subscribe to a user. Click on your name in the navbar. Then, simply be in the right place at the right time, and the file will automatically be ready for download. Once you've found a file, it will always be available to you.</p>

<p>GeoFlag was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. Login is handled by Facebook for Websites. Filepicker.io is used to upload files. The server uses MongoDB to save the files and their terms of access.</p>

<p>GeoFlag was created as a team project at PennApps in Spring 2013.</p>
