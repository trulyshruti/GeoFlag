        <p>Make LOCATION the key to unlock your files with GeoFlag!</p>

<p>File senders: You're just a few clicks away from secure file delivery - with limited terms set by you! Simply log in with Facebook, upload the file, then set the terms of access. Limit downloads to only certain locations or timeframes. That's all you need to do!</p>

<p>File receivers: Instantly retrieve the files you need! Know the terms sent by your file sender. Log into Facebook, and subscribe to a user. Then, check in to the right place, at the right time, and the file will be there, ready for download. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Great in a variety of scenarios - from professors keeping their students in attendance in the classroom, to event hosts sharing exclusive content with attendees, to the workplace that needs enhanced security. GeoFlag is the secure file sharing tool for the modern world.</p>

<p>GeoFlag was created as a team project at PennApps in Spring 2013.</p>
