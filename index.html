        <p>GeoFlag is a file sharing service that allows you to set the terms of access. You can limit file access not only by user or time, but also by location. You can send or receive files anywhere on the web, from your computer or even your mobile device.</p>

<p>To send a file, log in with Facebook, upload the file, then add a flag to limit its access. By default, your current location is set as the flag, but you can change this to any location in the world. Google Maps confirms the destination by pinning it on the map.</p>

<p>Once you've set a location flag, you can also limit the time frame during which the file can be accessed. But this is optional, and any file with no time limit can be accessed at the set location at any time by the file recipient. Once that's done, you'll receive an ID to give to the recipient.</p>

<p>To receive a file, log in with  Facebook, then click on your name in the navbar. Subscribe to a user with their given ID. Then, simply be in the right place at the right time, and the file will automatically be ready for download. Once you've found a file, you will always have access to it.</p>

<p>GeoFlag was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. Login is handled by Facebook for Websites. Filepicker.io is used to upload files. The server uses MongoDB to save the files and their terms of access.</p>

<p>GeoFlag was a team project made at PennApps in Spring 2013.</p>
