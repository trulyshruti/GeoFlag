GeoFlag
=======

Geolocation based file sharing. Project for PennApps 2013 Spring.

Description
=======
Make **LOCATION** the key to unlock your files with GeoFlag! 

***File sharers:*** You're just a few clicks away from secure file delivery - 
with limited terms (flags) set by you! 
Simply log in with Facebook, upload the file, then set the terms of access through adding flags. 
Limit downloads to only certain locations or timeframes. 
That's all you need to do! 

***File receivers:*** Instantly retrieve the files you need! Be surprised.
Log into Facebook and follow some sharers. 
When you've checked in to the right place, (at the right time,) the file will be there, ready for download. 
It's that simple! 

Great in a variety of scenarios - from professors keeping their students in attendance in the classroom, to event hosts sharing exclusive content
 with attendees, to the workplace that needs enhanced security. 
 GeoFlag is the exciting file sharing tool for the modern world.
